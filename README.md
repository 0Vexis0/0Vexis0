# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hasanvexis/">hasan vexis</a>'s IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio 🔐

Cybersecurity is a field I hold a great deal of respect for. I approach it through hands-on work, focusing on understanding how systems fail, how threats emerge, and how they can be addressed in practical ways. Many security issues stem not from malice, but from gaps in awareness and design. These projects reflect a steady effort to recognize those gaps and contribute work that strengthens security operations with clarity, responsibility, and purpose.
